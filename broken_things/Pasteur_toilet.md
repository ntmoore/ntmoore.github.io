# Leaking Toilet

The plumbing in Pasteur Hall is weird. all of the cold water lines are flushed with really hot water about once an hour.  Why?  We don't know - it might be a sanitation thing, and it might be a keep the pipes from freezing thing.

One day I noticed a related failure in the flushing of this toilet.  

Fixed via a call to maintenance.  I think they probably just tightened the nuts/collars holding the assembly together.
