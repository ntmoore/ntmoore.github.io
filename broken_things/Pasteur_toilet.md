# Leaking Toilet

The plumbing in Pasteur Hall is weird. All of the cold water lines are flushed with really hot water about once an hour.  Why?  We don't know - it might be a sanitation thing, and it might be a keep the pipes from freezing thing.

One day I noticed a related failure in the flushing of this toilet.  

Fixed via a call to maintenance.  I think they probably just tightened the nuts/collars holding the assembly together.  

However, it started leaking again a few weeks/months later.  The story I've heard is that when most of the plumbing fixtures were switched over to a high-pressure, low flow design (to save water!) a few years ago, many of the intermediate joints started to leak because they weren't installed/designed for high pressure flow.
