# Broken things

Here's a list of broken things that I broke, repaired, or gave up on.  These are my opinions, not those of the University or the State of Minnesota!  I'm not involved in any lawsuit!

## Inside my house
[Maytag dishwasher](dishwasher.md) that ate itself and turned into a toaster. 

[Garmin Vivoactive 3](Garmin_Watch.md) that had a very old worn-out battery.

## Outside my house

[John  Deere Mower Spindle](mower_spindle.md) for a 42C deck.
