# Broken things

Here's a list of broken things that I have noticed, broken, repaired, or gave up on.  These are my opinions, not those of the University or the State of Minnesota.  I'm not involved in any lawsuit!

## Inside my house
[Maytag dishwasher](dishwasher.md) that ate itself and turned into a toaster. 

[Garmin Vivoactive 3](Garmin_Watch.md) that had a very old worn-out battery.

The [brick fill](brick_fill.md) above our garage service door broke loose.

I had a pair of 40 year old [boots resoled](boots.md).

## In my backyard

[John  Deere Mower Spindle](mower_spindle.md) for a 42C deck. 

Most of the [plastic parts](JohnDeere_335_plastic.md) on my John Deere GX335 lawn tractor have cracked.

A [woodshed tipped over](woodshed.md) after a strong storm blew in.

I have a small solar irrigation system that I use for my garden.  [The pump doesn't last very long](solar_water_pump.md)

I got my finger caught in a rototiller.  [Xray showing bone that was ground away etc](finger.md)

## Cars and Trucks

The [keyless entry lock keypad](Ford_lock.md) on a Ford Truck.

[I hit a deer](Sienna_Deer.md) with my wife's van.

[My son hit a deer](volvo_deer.md) with a 2004 Volvo XC70.  We discovered it wasn't the first time the car had been in a front-end collision.

## At Work

One of the [toilets near my office](Pasteur_toilet.md) at work has a strange leak/movement failure that appeared after ~ 20 years of trouble-free use.

## Out and About
Here are some 100+ year old [grave markers](grave_markers.md) near Lewiston MN.

Bigelow Tea might not be [racist](tea.md). Honest!
