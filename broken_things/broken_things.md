# Broken things

Here's a list of broken things that I broke, repaired, or gave up on.  These are my opinions, not those of the University or the State of Minnesota.  I'm not involved in any lawsuit!

## Inside my house
[Maytag dishwasher](dishwasher.md) that ate itself and turned into a toaster. 

[Garmin Vivoactive 3](Garmin_Watch.md) that had a very old worn-out battery.

## In my backyard

[John  Deere Mower Spindle](mower_spindle.md) for a 42C deck. 

A [woodshed tipped over](woodshed.md) after a strong storm blew in.

I have a small solar irrigation system that I use for my garden.  [The pump doesn't last very long](solar_water_pump.md)

## Cars and Trucks

The [keyless entry lock keypad](Ford_lock.md) on a Ford Truck.

[I hit a deer](Sienna_Deer.md) with my wife's van.

## At Work

One of the [toilets near my office](Pasteur_toilet.md) at work has a strange leak/movement failure that appeared after ~ 20 years of trouble-free use.
