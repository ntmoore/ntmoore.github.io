Backstory: Purchased and installed unit in Summer 2021. Has not been cleaning dishes well lately (April 2024). When I removed the dishwasher from the counter to check the pump, I smelled a burning smell (toaster!), the motor was very very hot, and metal particle filter had disintegrated in the pump housing, causing jammed pump > stuck motor > overheat condition. It was pretty scary fire hazard! 

Notified Maytag/Whirlpool on 18 April.  Replaced the dishwasher with new, took the old unit to the metal scrapper in town, and Maytag/Whirlpool called me 21 May to tell me they couldn't "help me out" if there was no old unit available for them to look at (pictures weren't good enough I guess).
