I put most of the technical papers I write on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/search/physics?searchtype=author&query=Moore,+N+T)
Some of them have been published in technical journals, some haven't.  

- <https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06637> How many acres of potatoes does a society need? Published in The Physics Teacher, 2024.  [Supplemental calculations for the paper](https://github.com/ntmoore/food_energy_paper/blob/main/TPT_submission-shorter-2023-December/food_energy-supplemental_calculations.pdf) and an [ipython notbook about agricultural yields](https://github.com/ntmoore/food_energy_paper/blob/main/ag_yields_graph/make_figure.ipynb) are both available online. [MNCOSE 2023 Slides](./notes/MN_COSE_2023/summary.md)
- <https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00013> Don't throw that video away! Reference Frames can fix Video Analysis with a Moving Camera. Published in Physics Education, Dec 2023. Detailed calculations in [Vernier LoggerPro](https://github.com/ntmoore/video_analysis_Youtube/tree/master/moving_camera_paper/data), figure creation with [ipython notebooks](https://github.com/ntmoore/video_analysis_Youtube/tree/master/moving_camera_paper/python_figures), and and a demonstration of how to [grab and analyze youtube videos](https://github.com/ntmoore/video_analysis_Youtube/blob/master/README.md) are both available.
