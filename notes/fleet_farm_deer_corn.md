#Why does Fleet Farm sell "Deer Corn"?

Is it legal to feed birds in Minnesota?  Sure, but according to the feeding ban put in place by the DNR bird seed neds to be out of reach of deer.  Is it legal to pour corn in a pile and wait for deer to walk up?  <https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/cwd/feedban.html>
No. No it is not.

Per the web pages of the Minnesota and Wisconsin DNR, it is illegal to feed deer in Winona, Olmstead, Houston, Wabasha, Mower and Fillmore counties. On the Wisconsin side of the river, among others, feeding is banned in Pepin, Buffalo, Trempleau, and La Crosse counties.

Why is feeding banned? Chronic Wasting Disease, an always fatal brain disease, is spread by a small molecule that's present in deer and shed via urine, saliva, and feces. Deer bait piles are a giant pool of deer spit, and thus they're an effective transmission mechanism. There's no cure for CWD, and it isn't alarmist to say that there's no proof that people can't contract the disease by eating contaminated venison. (Google "CDC CWD Monkey" for more).

Given this information, why in the world does the Winona Fleet Farm have 50-pound bags of "Wild Deer Feed" on the shelf? If you were going to use this feed legally you’d have to drive more than 60 miles to get to a county where feeding is permitted! Fleet Farm shouldn't be in the business of willingly aiding people who break the feeding ban. Shame on you!
