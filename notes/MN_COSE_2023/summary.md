# How many potatoes does a society need? Using energy to make ethical claims.

Everyone eats food, but the Calorie requirements associated with life never quite seem to make it into the Physics textbooks I've used. I think that talking about the food requirements of a family, city, or country can be an illuminating connection to make when talking about energy. Talking about food energy also allows for surprisingly powerful ethical claims about how people have been oppressed in the past.

The talk includes several classroom-ready discussions/problems, featuring: Cannibalism in Aztec culture (was it necessary because they were starving?), The Irish Potato famine (was it a "Natural Disaster"?), and the practicality of living off the land.

Here are the slides from my MNCOSE 2023 talk. [MN COSE 2023 Slides](link_to_slides)
